# _lib.ps1 (S1537) - shared state for the ALL_FEATURES inventory mutators.
#
# Dot-source it; it has no side effects of its own and never opens an inventory file on load.
#
# Cross-process serialization. The critical section is not the write - it is the whole
# read -> mutate -> write path. Two processes call Read-FeatureLines, both hold the same
# snapshot, and the second Write-FeatureLines replaces the file with its own stale base plus
# its own change; the first record vanishes with no error and exit code 0 on both sides.
# Measured on the unlocked code: eight concurrent add.ps1 calls landed four records out of
# eight. So the lock is taken by the CALLER around its whole section - Write-FeatureLines
# cannot do it alone, however atomic it is. Same conclusion, same shape and same reason as
# scripts/spec_catalog/_lib.ps1 (S1437); the two CLIs stay independent, each with its own
# mutex, so a spec-catalog write never waits on an inventory write.
#
# A system mutex, not a lock file: an inventory rewrite is milliseconds, while the BUILD/CODE
# lock family is sized for edits and builds (3-60 min windows, queue directories,
# reservations) and would be absurd here. The mutex also dies with its process, so a crashed
# holder cannot wedge the inventory - that is what the AbandonedMutexException branch is for.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The three CLIs here each carried the same six names as a literal, so a seventh flavor
        declared in productFlavors was rejected by every one of them while validate.ps1's own gate
        check - which reads docs/FLAVOR_MATRIX.md - was already demanding it. The matrix is
        generated from that same productFlavors block, so its header is the one list that cannot
        go stale silently.

        Returns an empty array when the matrix cannot be read or carries no header, so the caller
        keeps its own fallback instead of having one guessed here.
