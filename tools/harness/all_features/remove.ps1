.SYNOPSIS
    Remove one record from the ALL_FEATURES inventory (docs/ALL_FEATURES.jsonl), by id.

.DESCRIPTION
    The counterpart to add.ps1's upsert: a physical delete, not a status flip.
    patch.ps1 -Status removed keeps the record in the file, where /skill-release
    reads it as a capability that was withdrawn and prints it in the release
    notes - which is right for a real feature that shipped and then went away,
    and wrong for a record that should never have existed (a mistaken add, or a
    probe written by a test harness).

    Deliberately hard to fire by accident, mirroring scripts/spec_catalog/delete.ps1:
    without -Confirm the call only reports what it would remove and exits 1. An id
    that is not in the inventory is not an error - the call is a no-op and exits 0,
    so repeated cleanup is idempotent.

    Write convention (line order, LF, UTF-8 without BOM) is add.ps1's, so a file
    round-tripped through add + remove is byte-identical to the original.

.PARAMETER Id
    Record id to remove, exactly as it appears in the inventory ('<area>.<feature>').

.PARAMETER Confirm
    Apply the removal. Without it, the call is a dry run that exits 1.

.PARAMETER NoLegal
    Operate on the gitignored docs/ALL_FEATURES_noLegal.jsonl instead.

.PARAMETER Quiet
    Suppress the success line.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\all_features\remove.ps1 -Id "spec-tooling.sandbox_probe" -Confirm

.NOTES
    Exit codes:
      0 record removed, or no such id (no-op).
      1 invalid invocation, -Confirm withheld, or the inventory could not be read or written.
