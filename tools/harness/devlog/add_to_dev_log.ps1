<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Appends a structured entry to the development changelog (dev/CHANGELOG.md).

.DESCRIPTION
    Every code modification by an AI agent or developer must be logged.
    This script appends a timestamped line to dev/CHANGELOG.md in a
    machine-readable, grep-friendly format.

.PARAMETER FilePath
    Relative path to the modified file (e.g. app_v2/src/.../MyClass.kt).

.PARAMETER Target
    Class name, function name, or module affected (e.g. "GoogleDriveRestClient" or "shouldRefreshToken").

.PARAMETER Description
    Short English description of the change and its purpose.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\add_to_dev_log.ps1 "app_v2/src/.../GlideAppModule.kt" "GlideAppModule" "Fixed memory cache formula: heap*10% cap 64MB instead of availMem*40%"

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\add_to_dev_log.ps1 "AGENTS.md" "AGENTS.md" "Added mandatory dev changelog logging rule"

.NOTES
    Exit codes:
    0 - the entry was appended, or skipped as a recent duplicate (both are success: the row the
        caller asked for is present either way).
    1 - the changelog lock could not be taken within the timeout, so nothing was written. A row
        that was silently dropped reads exactly like a closure that never ran, so this fails loud.

# serialising that was the Code.Scripts domain lock, taken incidentally because dev/ is in its

# Dedup guard: a retried post-change / facade re-run must not append an identical
# entry. Compare the semantic signature (file | target | desc), ignoring the
# timestamp and branch tag, against the most recent entries. Observed failure:
# three identical S1181 rows within 6 min from repeated post-change runs.
#
# S1622: the `[set of N: ..]` tail is written by post-change.ps1, not by the caller, and
# it is the one part of the description that CHANGES between two runs of the same closure -
# fixing what an advisory named usually regenerates a file, which then joins the set. So it
# is normalised out of both sides: it may not identify the change. Everything the caller
# actually wrote still does. Measured 2026-08-13: since the tail appeared on 2026-08-08 the
# guard caught every exact repeat, and the only two rows that escaped it were of this shape.
#
# The signature closes on the `[branch:` marker that follows the description in every row,
# so it matches a whole description and not a prefix of one - before this, a row described
# as "Fix A" counted as a duplicate of a row described as "Fix A and B".
#
# S2072: the anchor file is NOT part of the key either. post-change.ps1 writes the first element
# of the caller's -Files set into the File column, so the anchor encodes file ORDER, not the
# identity of the change - and the closure rule asks the caller to name the whole set, which an
# agent re-running a closure after fixing a gate naturally rebuilds shorter or in another order.
# That moved the anchor, the signature missed, and a second permanent row landed for one logical
# change (observed on S2000: same target, same description, 37-file set then 16-file set). What
# identifies a change is what the caller asserted about it - target plus description - so those
# are the whole key. Two genuinely distinct changes sharing both, inside the 8-row window, are
# what -AllowDuplicate is for; collapsing them is also what Rule 12 journalling granularity asks.
