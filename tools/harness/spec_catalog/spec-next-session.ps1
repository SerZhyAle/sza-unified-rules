# spec-next-session.ps1 - Persistent round state for /spec-next and /spec-do (S1339)
#
# Problem this solves:
#   /spec-next accumulates context across many rounds. `processed`, the
#   running session tally, `deviceOnline` and `selectedDevice` used to live
#   only in the agent's memory, so a context-threshold reset (/clear) lost
#   them and every resume had to re-derive state from scratch. This script
#   persists that state to disk so a reset is just a resume.
#
# Ownership (S1396, revised by S1437):
#   The state path used to be fixed, so two concurrent /spec-next sessions shared one file and
#   the second session's -Verb Init silently wiped the first one's processed set, tally and
#   device facts (observed 2026-08-05). S1396 answered that by stamping an owner and refusing
#   the second session; S1437 answers it properly by giving each session its own file, so both
#   run and neither refuses. Duplicate ticket pickup - the reason the refusal existed - is now
#   prevented one layer up by the ticket lease (scripts/spec_catalog/ticket-lease.ps1).
#
#   The owner is NOT an OS process - each invocation is a separate short-lived pwsh.exe and
#   nothing survives between them - so BUILD.LOCK's pid-liveness model does not apply.
#   Ownership is keyed on the agent session id, and the liveness VERDICT comes from
#   Get-AgentTicketLiveness in scripts/utils/agent-lock.ps1 rather than from a second copy of
#   the rule here. No session id in the environment -> ownership is undefined and the checks
#   below are no-ops.
#
# Storage: temp/spec-next-session.<sessionId>.json (one per session)
# Schema (one session record):
#   {
#     "round": 1,
#     "startedAt": "2026-08-01T11:40:00",
#     "threshold": 300000,
#     "deviceOnline": false,
#     "selectedDevice": null,
#     "owner": { "sessionId": "<uuid>", "host": "PC", "pid": 1234,
#                "stampedAt": "2026-08-01T11:40:00", "lastSeenAt": "2026-08-01T11:55:00" },
#     "handoffAt": null,   // set by -Verb Handoff = "parked, waiting to be resumed" (S1437);
#                          // cleared by -Verb Resume. The one signal that separates a round
#                          // stopped for a context reset from a sibling working right now.
#     "processed": [
#       { "id": "S1339", "outcome": "verified", "note": "", "firstAt": "2026-08-01T11:50:00",
#         "at": "2026-08-01T11:55:00" }
#     ],
#     "tally": { "processed": 0, "verified": 0, "blocked": 0 }
#   }
#
# Verbs:
#   -Verb Init          - start a fresh session (overwrites prior state - round memory is
#                          session-scoped, per /spec-next's own hard rule - but refuses when a
#                          live foreign owner holds the file; -Force takes it over anyway).
#   -Verb Record         - record a processed ticket, keyed by id: a repeat id updates that
#                          entry in place and the tally is recomputed, never incremented.
#   -Verb Device          - persist device-probe facts (Stage 0).
#   -Verb CheckContext    - mechanical threshold check against the live transcript.
#   -Verb Resume           - continue a prior session: bump round, adopt ownership, return
#                            -Exclude CSV + device facts + the displaced owner.
#   -Verb Report            - end-of-session summary, reconstructable after a reset.
#   -Verb Handoff             - one-screen stop block: what happened, why, what's next, recommended commands.
#
# Usage:
#   spec-next-session.ps1 -Verb Init [-Threshold 300000] [-Force] [-StaleMinutes 45]
#   spec-next-session.ps1 -Verb Record -Id Sxxxx -Outcome <advanced|verified|blocked|skipped> [-Note "text"]
#   spec-next-session.ps1 -Verb Device -Online <true|false> [-SelectedDevice <id>]
#   spec-next-session.ps1 -Verb CheckContext [-Threshold N]
#   spec-next-session.ps1 -Verb Resume
#   spec-next-session.ps1 -Verb Report
#   spec-next-session.ps1 -Verb Handoff
#
# Exit codes (S1070 contract):
#   0 - ok.
#   1 - error (missing state file where one is required, write failure).
#   2 - cannot verify (bad -Id on Record; CheckContext could not determine tokens).
#   3 - threshold crossed (CheckContext only).
#   (4 was "refused: a live foreign owner holds the state file". Retired in S1437 - the state
#    file is per session now, so there is no foreign owner to refuse. Not reused, so an old
#    caller still testing for 4 reads a code this script can no longer return.)

        Two cases, one mechanism:

            the upgrade;
          - another session's per-session file whose owner is gone - which is the NORMAL resume
            path, because /clear gives the resuming agent a NEW session id, so the round it is
            resuming is always filed under the OLD one. Without this, /spec-next --resume after a
            threshold stop would find nothing and lose the round the state file exists to save.

        A file owned by a session that is still ALIVE is never taken: that is a sibling working
        its own round, not an orphan. Newest adoptable file wins when several qualify.
        Only ever runs when this session has no state of its own, so it cannot clobber live state.
