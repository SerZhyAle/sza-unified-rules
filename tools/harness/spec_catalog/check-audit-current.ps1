.SYNOPSIS
    Gate: the recorded audit judged the task text the spec carries NOW (S2367).

.DESCRIPTION
    `Verified` asserts that an audit passed; `BlockNeedUserTest` asserts that the work is
    ready for a human to observe. Both are claims about a task, and neither is worth
    anything if the task changed after the claim was written.

    S2298 made the verdict provable by requiring the `## Last Audit` block. It cannot tell
    a verdict written against the current task from one written against a task the owner
    has since rewritten - and the owner does rewrite it: a spec is edited mid-run by the
    owner, by /spec-quiz writing an answer into it, and by a sibling session. The pipeline
    reads the spec once at Stage 0 and works from that reading for the rest of the run.

    This gate closes that window. The block records a `**Task fingerprint:**`, the gate
    recomputes it over the file on disk, and a mismatch means the audit judged different
    words than the ones the ticket is being closed against. The fix is never a flag: re-read
    the task and re-run the audit, which rewrites both the verdict and the stamp.

    What is hashed and why the pipeline's own writes are excluded from it lives in
    _task-fingerprint.ps1, shared verbatim with every writer, so this gate cannot refuse a
    stamp the writer considers correct (the S1621 rule).

    Deliberately silent about WHETHER the verdict is good: that judgement is /spec-check's,
    and a gate second-guessing it by keyword would be a verdict nobody could act on.

.PARAMETER Id
    Ticket id, Sxxxx.

.NOTES
    Exit codes:
      0 - the audit block stamps the current task text.
      1 - no stamp, or the stamp names a different task text than the file now carries.
      2 - bad invocation (malformed id, or an id no record carries), or catalog / spec
          unreadable. Kept distinct from 1 for the reason check-probe-present.ps1 states:
          "this ticket does not exist" and "this ticket was audited against stale text"
          call for opposite reactions, and exit 1 phrases the refusal as the latter.
