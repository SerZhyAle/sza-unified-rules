# Gate for transitions INTO a closed status (Implemented / Verified) - see S1606.
#
# Contract:
#   - A closed spec must not carry load-bearing evidence in temp/Sxxxx/. temp/ is
#     declared disposable (CLAUDE.md Rule 1), so a reference there is a promise the
#     repository is not obliged to keep: the file may be swept at any time while the
#     spec keeps saying "Verified". Measured 2026-08-13, 65% of the temp/ paths cited
#     by archived specs already pointed at nothing.
#   - Durable evidence lives in the spec's own directory PLAN/Sxxxx_<slug>/ and is
#     committed, capped at 64 KB per file. Above the cap: reduce to the verdict-bearing
#     extract, or replace the artifact with a reproducing command.
#   - Section 0 is exempt. /spec-draft captures owner/agent text verbatim and its
#     contract forbids editing it; S1606's own capture cites temp/ paths and would
#     otherwise be unfixable without breaking that guarantee.
#   - Archived is deliberately NOT gated: it closes a ticket that already passed this
#     gate, and blocking cleanup would make tidying the catalog harder than leaving it.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = no temp/ evidence outside §0. 1 = blockers reported. 2 = bad invocation.
