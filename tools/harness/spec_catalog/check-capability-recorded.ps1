.SYNOPSIS
    Remind, at closing time, that a spec claiming user-visible impact left no inventory record (S1665).

.DESCRIPTION
    `docs/ALL_FEATURES.jsonl` is the source of truth for shipped capabilities, and a closed ticket that
    never wrote its record makes its capability invisible to everything built on top of that file. S1654
    measured the damage: of 1549 closed specs, 275 declare user-visible impact in their own section 8 and
    have no record at all - so the guide-coverage gate reports full coverage over an inventory that is
    missing a fifth of what shipped.

    The signal is the spec's own section 8, "Влияние на пользователя". Its default text says the change is
    invisible; anything else is the author stating that something user-facing shipped. That is a claim by
    the person who did the work, not a guess made afterwards from a title or a tier - which is why a
    ticket named `bugfix-` is not excluded: fixing visible behaviour changes the inventory too, through a
    FIX rather than an ADD.

    ADVISORY BY CONSTRUCTION. This script never blocks a transition, and its caller in `_lib.ps1` keeps it
    in a list that cannot throw. A hard gate here would be wrong: bugfix specs written in the compact form
    have no section 8 at all, and tooling and documentation tickets legitimately ship no capability - so a
    refusal would make closing them impossible. A reminder that the author can act on is the whole product.

    Exit codes:
      0 - nothing to say, or the reminder was printed. Both are a successful run.
      2 - cannot verify: the spec file or the inventory is unreadable. Distinct from 0 so a caller can tell
          "looked and found nothing" from "could not look", even though neither blocks.

.PARAMETER Id
    Spec id (S####).
