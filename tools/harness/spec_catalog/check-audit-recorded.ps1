.SYNOPSIS
    Gate: a spec handed on as Verified or BlockNeedUserTest carries a written verdict (S2298, S2367).

.PARAMETER Id
    Ticket id, Sxxxx.

.NOTES
    Exit codes:
      0 - the spec carries a non-empty `## Last Audit` block.
      1 - the block is absent, or present with nothing under it.
      2 - bad invocation (malformed id, or an id no record carries), or catalog / spec unreadable.

# Gate for a transition INTO Verified (S2298) or BlockNeedUserTest (S2367).
#
# Contract:
#   - `Verified` means "the audit passed". The audit's verdict lives in exactly one
#     place, the `## Last Audit` block of the spec file: /spec-check writes it, /spec-fix
#     reads it, and no separate audit registry exists. A ticket reaching Verified without
#     that block asserts a result it cannot show - the class CLAUDE.md section 12 forbids.
#   - Measured 2026-09-01 across every live Verified spec: 7 of 129 carry no block at all
#     (S1783, S1872, S2002, S2053, S2197, S2263, S2280). Their spec files attribute the
#     closure to three different paths - /spec-all, /spec-code and no marker at all - so
#     the missing check is not a defect of one command. Assert-ClosingGates is the one
#     point every path passes through, which is why the gate sits there.
#   - `BlockNeedUserTest` joined the gated set in S2367. It hands the work to the owner,
#     which is a claim about coverage as much as Verified is, and measured 2026-09-02 it was
#     made 72 times out of 158 with no block at all. Its verdict is written WITHOUT running
#     /spec-check - see the pre-handoff block in .claude/commands/spec-code.md - because
#     /spec-check would flip the ticket out of the status and delete the probes the pending
#     device test needs (S2324). Same requirement, different writer.
#   - `Implemented` is deliberately NOT gated, unlike the two sibling closing gates:
#     it means "the code is done", and no audit has run by then by definition. Gating it
#     would demand a verdict before the thing that produces one.
#   - The block is found by HEADING TEXT through Get-AuditSectionHeadingPattern in
#     `_research-items.ps1`, shared verbatim with preview.ps1, so this gate's verdict and
#     the operator's `last_audit_present` flag cannot drift apart (the S1621 rule). Live
#     specs number their headings: `## 6. Last Audit` is a real spelling, and a literal
#     '## Last Audit' test reports it as absent.
#   - A heading with no content under it fails too. An empty block is the same absence of
#     evidence as no block, only with a table of contents.
#   - Archived is not reached: Assert-ClosingGates gates only Implemented and Verified.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = the spec carries a non-empty audit block. 1 = block absent or empty.
#             2 = bad invocation, or catalog / spec unreadable.
