# Shared fingerprint of a spec's TASK TEXT - the thing an audit claims to have judged (S2367).
#
# Dot-sourced, never invoked. Holds no mutable state and does not read the catalog, so a
# consumer inherits only these functions. Separate from `_lib.ps1` for the same reason
# `_research-items.ps1` is: the gate and the writer must agree byte for byte, and a second
# implementation of "which part of the file is the task" would let the gate refuse a
# transition the writer considers stamped (the S1621 rule).
#
# What counts as the task text: the strategic spec file MINUS the parts the pipeline writes
# into it on its own.
#   - `**Status:**`, `**Status note:**` and `**Priority:**` header lines. Sync-SpecHeaderStatus
#     rewrites the first two on every transition and the closure may recompute the third, so
#     including them would make the fingerprint differ from itself across the very status flip
#     it guards.
#   - The whole `## Last Audit` block. It is the audit's own output; hashing it would mean the
#     stamp could never match the file that carries it.
# Everything else is the task: the captured material, the problem, the goals, the constraints,
# the owner inputs, the research items and the acceptance criteria.
#
# The tactical folder is deliberately NOT part of it. Those files are the agent's own plan and
# its step ticks move continuously during implementation; folding them in would fire the gate
# on the pipeline's own work rather than on an edit to the task.
#
# Compatible with PowerShell 5.1 and 7+, and safe to load under Set-StrictMode Latest.

# Loadable standalone: a consumer that already has _research-items.ps1 (every path through
# _lib.ps1) must not re-source it, because that would reset its module-scoped root variable
# under a different $PSScriptRoot binding.
