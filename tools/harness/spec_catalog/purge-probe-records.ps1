.SYNOPSIS
  One-off (idempotent) cleanup: remove preview.tests probe records from the ARCHIVE journal.
.DESCRIPTION
  Until S1534 the preview.tests harness inserted its throwaway probes into the production catalog
  with ids from the real next-id.ps1. delete.ps1 is a soft delete, so each probe left a row in
  PLAN/spec-catalog-archive.jsonl for good - 21 of them by 2026-08-09 - and select.ps1 -Id answered
  an id lookup with a test fixture. The harness no longer writes the real journals; this removes
  what it already wrote.

  Deliberately NOT a general-purpose purge. A -Purge switch on delete.ps1 was rejected in S1534
  section 3.1: it would put an irreversible operation into production tooling to compensate for a
  test defect. This script removes only rows that are simultaneously status 'Archived' AND named
  '^preview-tests-probe', and nothing else can be passed to it.

  Every purged id is first recorded in PLAN/spec-catalog-burned-ids.jsonl. New-CatalogId reads that
  registry alongside both journals, so an id cannot return to circulation just because its row went
  away - two tickets answering to one id would make every dev-log row and commit message naming it
  ambiguous after the fact. validate.ps1 reads the same registry to tell a deliberate hole in the id
  sequence from a lost record.

  Guard: New-CatalogId is computed before and after the rewrite, and a move restores the original
  archive and fails. With the registry written first this should be unreachable - it stays as the
  second belt, because the failure it catches is silent and permanent.
.NOTES
  Exit codes:
    0 - purged, or nothing to purge (idempotent re-run).
    1 - error (archive unreadable, lock timeout, write failure).
    3 - guard tripped: the purge would have changed the next allocatable id. Archive restored.
