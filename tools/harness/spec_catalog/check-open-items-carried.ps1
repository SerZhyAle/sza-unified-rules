# Gate for transitions INTO a closed status (Implemented / Verified) - see S1607.
#
# Contract:
#   - Section 6 ("Открытые вопросы / Research items") is the only place a question
#     belonging to the owner is recorded. Nothing checked it at closing time, so a
#     spec could reach Verified carrying a live Open item. From that moment the
#     question is invisible: a closed ticket leaves PLAN/RELEASE_QUEUE.md, and
#     /spec-quiz answers "report and stop" for terminal statuses. Measured
#     2026-08-13: 134 of 1506 closed specs carry 372 such items, 8.9% of closures.
#   - At closing time every section 6 item must be in one of exactly two states:
#     Resolved, carrying its answer; or Open, carrying a literal carrier token
#     `Carrier: Sxxxx` (or `Носитель: Sxxxx`) that names the ticket which now owns
#     the question. The carrier is an ordinary catalog record, so it reappears in
#     PLAN/RELEASE_QUEUE.md on its own and the queue's ordering rule 6 batches it
#     into /spec-quiz. No new source of truth is introduced.
#   - The token is read literally, for the same reason `Blocker: Sxxxx` in section
#     10 is literal: the surrounding prose names neighbours as well as owners, so a
#     bare id cannot say which way the arrow points (S1482).
#   - The section is found by HEADING TEXT, never by the number 6: live specs put
#     unrelated content under `## 6.` and move the research section elsewhere. The
#     whole parse - heading list, status spellings, item grouping, carrier token -
#     lives in `_research-items.ps1` and is shared verbatim with `preview.ps1`, so
#     the gate's verdict and the operator's count cannot drift apart (S1621).
#   - An unfilled template placeholder (`Open / Resolved`, copied verbatim from
#     `.claude/templates/strategic-spec.md`) counts as open and is named as such:
#     the item was never decided either way, which is exactly what this gate is for.
#   - Archived is deliberately NOT gated: it closes a ticket that already passed
#     this gate, and blocking cleanup would make tidying harder than leaving it.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every section 6 item is resolved or carried. 1 = uncarried open
#             items reported. 2 = bad invocation, or catalog / spec unreadable.
