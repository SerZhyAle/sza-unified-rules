# Shared parser for a spec's research / open-questions section.
#
# Dot-sourced, never invoked: this file sets no preferences, holds no mutable state and
# knows nothing about the catalog journal, so a consumer inherits only these functions.
# That is the point of it being separate from `_lib.ps1` - `preview.ps1` sits on the
# `/spec-next` hot path and cannot afford `_lib.ps1`'s `Set-StrictMode -Version Latest`,
# under which its own `$rec.statusNote` read throws on any record without a note (S1621).
#
# Consumers: `_lib.ps1` (which re-exports these to the whole spec_catalog CLI),
# `check-open-items-carried.ps1` (the closing gate) and `preview.ps1` (the operator's
# count). One parse, one definition - before S1621 the gate and the preview disagreed
# on 163 of 1601 spec files, including three where the preview printed 0 against live
# open items.
#
# Compatible with PowerShell 5.1 and 7+, and safe to load under Set-StrictMode Latest.

# Both this file and every consumer live in scripts/spec_catalog/, so the repo root is
# the same two levels up whichever of them $PSScriptRoot was bound from.
