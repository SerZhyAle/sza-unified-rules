# One-shot migration for S1620: move the closed-spec archive from the disposable,
# git-ignored temp/done/ into version-controlled PLAN/archive/, and repair the journal
# records whose `file` still points at the PLAN/ path the spec occupied before archiving.
#
# Background: archive.ps1 used to move the artefact but keep the original `file` value,
# so 1502 of 1504 archived records named a path that no longer existed. Both halves are
# fixed here - the files move, and every archived record is re-pointed at where its file
# actually ends up.
#
# Idempotent: a record already pointing into PLAN/archive/ with the file present is left
# alone, so a re-run after a partial migration completes the remainder instead of undoing it.
# Dry-run by default; pass -Apply to write.
#
# Exit codes: 0 - migration reported (or applied) with no failure; 1 - at least one record
# could not be migrated; 2 - the migration cannot run (journal or source directory missing).
