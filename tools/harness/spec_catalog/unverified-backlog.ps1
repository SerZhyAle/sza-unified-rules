.SYNOPSIS
    Report the shipped-but-unproven backlog: BlockNeedUserTest against Verified (S1338).

.DESCRIPTION
    The ship-to-verify ratio measured 6.9:1 - 87 tickets parked in BlockNeedUserTest against
    39 Verified, with 38% of the catalog shipped and never proven on a device. An autonomous
    loop that keeps chaining tickets while that pile grows is manufacturing unverified work,
    so S1339's loop needs a machine-readable stop reason. This script is that number.

    It reads the ACTIVE journal only - an archived ticket is closed, not pending - counts the
    two statuses, computes the ratio, and compares the BlockNeedUserTest count to -Ceiling.

    Live probe tags are reported alongside as a second symptom of the same backlog: every
    ticket in BlockNeedUserTest is supposed to carry `Timber.d("Sxxxx: ..")` lines in source,
    and they are removed on the way out (CLAUDE.md "Debug Verification Tags"). Counting is
    opt-in via -IncludeTags because it walks app_v2/src and wear/src.

.PARAMETER Ceiling
    Maximum acceptable BlockNeedUserTest count. Exceeded -> exit 3. Omitted -> report only.

.PARAMETER IncludeTags
    Also count live `Timber.d("Sxxxx:` probe lines and the files carrying them.

.PARAMETER Json
    Emit one JSON object instead of the human-readable lines. This is the shape S1339 parses.

.NOTES
    Exit codes (CLAUDE.md Rule 7):
      0  read the catalog; BlockNeedUserTest is at or below -Ceiling, or no ceiling was given.
      1  error - the catalog could not be parsed.
      2  cannot verify - the catalog journal does not exist.
      3  -Ceiling exceeded.

    Contract note: S1339's loop consumes these exit codes and the -Json field names. Changing
    either is a breaking change for that ticket.
