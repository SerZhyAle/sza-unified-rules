# preview.ps1 - One-shot Stage 3 metadata extractor for a spec
#
# Replaces this bash boilerplate run on every /spec-next round:
#   head -25 PLAN/Sxxxx_*.md
#   grep -n "^## " PLAN/Sxxxx_*.md
#   ls -la PLAN/ | grep Sxxxx
#   grep "Timber\.d\(.Sxxxx:" type=kt
#   select.ps1 -Id Sxxxx
#   select.ps1 -Id <blocker> (for §10 resolution)
#
# All collapsed into one pwsh invocation, one JSON blob.
#
# Exit codes (S1070):
#   0 - preview emitted.
#   2 - cannot run: malformed -Id, spec absent from the catalog, or its file missing
#       on disk. There is no code 1: this is an extractor, not a gate - it either
#       produces the payload or cannot.
