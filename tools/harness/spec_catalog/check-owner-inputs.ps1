# Gate for Draft -> Approved transition of strategic specs.
#
# Contract (relevance-driven, no hardcoded field list):
#   - A strategic spec must contain a "### 3.3 Owner inputs (Approval gate)" subsection.
#   - The set of bullets inside §3.3 is decided by /spec at draft time, based on
#     the spec's detected character (UI / data / flavor / executable scope).
#   - The gate validates only what is actually present in §3.3 - every bullet
#     must carry a concrete value (not a bracketed placeholder, not empty).
#     "n/a - <reason>" counts as a concrete value.
#   - This gate judges §3.3 and nothing else. The house text style does not apply
#     to specification files - the canon's scope list excludes specs by name, next
#     to code, commands and logs - so a spec's punctuation is not gated here or at
#     any other transition (S1543). The earlier version of this gate scanned the
#     whole file for an ellipsis, which reached §0 verbatim owner capture and
#     twice forced an edit inside material /spec-draft guarantees untouched.
#   - Universally required: 'Related tickets'. This is the only field that
#     must be present regardless of spec scope. It encodes dependency chains
#     consumed by /spec-next and bulk-update.ps1.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = ready for Approved. 1 = blockers reported. 2 = bad invocation.
