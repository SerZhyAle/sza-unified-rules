.SYNOPSIS
    Print the task-text fingerprint of a spec, for stamping into its `## Last Audit` block (S2367).

.DESCRIPTION
    The writer's half of the S2367 pair. `check-audit-current.ps1` refuses a transition into
    `Verified` or `BlockNeedUserTest` when the audit block does not stamp the task text the
    file carries now; this prints the value that stamp must hold.

    Both sides call Get-SpecTaskFingerprint in _task-fingerprint.ps1, so what counts as "the
    task" is defined once. The stamp is stable across the write itself: the `## Last Audit`
    block and the `**Status:**` header are excluded from the hash, so computing it before
    writing the block, and again after the status flip, yields the same value.

    Use -Line to emit the whole markdown line rather than the bare digest - a hand-typed
    stamp with the label spelled differently is a stamp the gate cannot read.

.PARAMETER Id
    Ticket id, Sxxxx. Resolved against the catalog. Mutually exclusive with -Path.

.PARAMETER Path
    Spec file, repo-relative or absolute. Use for a file the catalog does not carry yet.

.PARAMETER Line
    Emit `**Task fingerprint:** <digest>` instead of the bare digest.

.NOTES
    Exit codes:
      0 - fingerprint printed.
      2 - bad invocation (neither or both selectors, malformed id, id no record carries),
          or the spec file is unreadable. There is no exit 1: this script reports a value,
          it judges nothing.
