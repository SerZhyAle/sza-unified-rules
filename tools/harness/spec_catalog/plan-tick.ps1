.SYNOPSIS
    Batch state writer for tactical-plan steps (S1596).

.DESCRIPTION
    Executing a tactical plan used to cost one markdown edit per state change, on two surfaces:
    the step's inline marker in the phase file and the counters in INDEX.md. Measured over
    2026-08-05..11 that was 1 437 of 2 358 plan-file edits - about 61%, one turn each. This
    script moves an explicit list of steps in one operation.

    THERE IS NO WHOLE-PHASE FORM, and that is a safety property, not an omission. The cost of
    marking one unfinished step done exceeds the cost of the edits a short form would save, and
    the explicit list is also the execution trace: a process audit reads the transcript, and an
    invocation carrying ticket, phase and step numbers proves which steps were executed, where
    the hand edit it replaces only proved that some plan file changed.

    Every state is reversible through the same parameter, so a wrong batch is undone the way it
    was made.

.PARAMETER Id
    Ticket id, Sxxxx. Its plan folder is PLAN/<Id>_<slug>/.

.PARAMETER Phase
    Phase number, one or two digits. Selects PLAN/<Id>_<slug>/PHASE_<Phase>__*.md.

.PARAMETER Steps
    Comma-separated step numbers. Either bare (3,4,5) or fully qualified (02.3,02.4).
    A number with no matching step in the phase file is an error, never a silent no-op.

.PARAMETER State
    NotDone     -> `[ ]` not done
    InProgress  -> `[~]` in progress
    Done        -> `[x]` done
    Manual      -> `[manual - deferred]` <note>

.PARAMETER Note
    Trailing prose for the marker. On Done it replaces any existing trailing prose; without it
    existing prose is preserved. On Manual it is the body of the marker and is required.

.PARAMETER Log
    Text for the Step Log entry written when a step moves to Done. Defaults to -Note, then to a
    generated line. Separate from -Note because the marker carries a short clause and the log
    carries the account of the run; one parameter serving both forced a paragraph into the marker.

.PARAMETER Checkbox
    Comma-separated label fragments naming ordinary GFM bullets (- [ ] / - [x]) to flip.
    Mutually exclusive with -Steps. A fragment matching no bullet, or more than one, is an
    error naming the candidates - a guess here would tick the wrong gate silently.
    The separator is a comma, so a fragment may not contain one; pick a comma-free substring
    of the bullet instead.

.PARAMETER Target
    Which file the -Checkbox fragments are matched in: Phase (default) or Index.

.PARAMETER Json
    Emit a machine-readable summary instead of console lines.

.PARAMETER Reconcile
    Permit a requested step rewrite to repair a stale INDEX.md step counter from the phase file's
    markers first. Without this explicit switch, a counter disagreement still exits 3 untouched.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/spec_catalog/plan-tick.ps1 -Id S1596 -Phase 02 -Steps 3,4,5 -State Done
    Marks steps 02.3, 02.4 and 02.5 done in one call.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/spec_catalog/plan-tick.ps1 -Id S1596 -Phase 02 -Steps 3,4,5 -State NotDone
    Undoes the batch above.

.EXIT CODES
    0 - every listed step was rewritten.
    1 - a listed step was not found, or a file could not be written.
    2 - usage error, or the plan folder or phase file does not exist.
    3 - INDEX.md and the phase file disagreed before the write; nothing was written at all.
    4 - a -Checkbox fragment matched no bullet, or matched more than one.
