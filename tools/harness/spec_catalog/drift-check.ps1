# drift-check.ps1 - Detect "fix already in code" drift for a spec
#
# Pattern this catches:
#   Spec is written at time T0 describing a broken behaviour.
#   Code fix is committed at time T1 > T0 with a // Sxxxx: marker.
#   No one updates the spec.
#   /spec-all on the spec wastes 5+ minutes "implementing" what is already done.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -File scripts/spec_catalog/drift-check.ps1 -Id Sxxxx
#   pwsh -File scripts/spec_catalog/drift-check.ps1 -Id Sxxxx -Format json
#
# Output (table):
#   S0235 drift-check (since 2026-05-17 01:52)
#     commit history: not consulted (S1634)
#     code lines with // Sxxxx::      3  in 2 files
#     verdict: DRIFT - fix likely in code, spec stale
#
# Output (json):
#   {"id":"S0235","verdict":"DRIFT","commits":[],"code_markers":[...]}
#
# Verdicts (S1429, narrowed by S1634):
#   CLEAN       - no inline marker carries the id.
#   DRIFT       - inline `// Sxxxx:` markers exist: work is in the tree that nothing accounts for.
#   COMMIT_ONLY - retired. Kept in the contract so an older caller still parses, never returned.
#                 It reported that a commit mentioned the id, which in a one-developer,
#                 one-branch, commit-the-whole-tree repository was true of nearly every ticket.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - no drift detected (CLEAN)
#   1 - drift detected (inline markers found post-spec-creation)
#   2 - usage / resolution error
