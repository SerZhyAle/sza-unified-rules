# Gate for a transition INTO a gated status - see S2357.
#
# Contract:
#   - A spec file may carry the same section twice. Nothing else in the repository can
#     see that, because the shared section parser (Get-SpecSectionLines in
#     `_research-items.ps1`) stops at the next '## ' once it has entered a section, so
#     every consumer reads the FIRST copy and the rest of the file does not exist for it.
#     The duplicate therefore does not add noise - it silently substitutes whichever copy
#     sorted higher for the one a reader meant.
#   - Measured 2026-09-02 over all 1395 files under PLAN/: three carried the defect, in
#     three different shapes. S1884 had its `## Last Audit` block split in two, leaving a
#     three-line stub with no `**Outcome:**` on top - and check-audit-recorded.ps1, the
#     S2298 gate whose whole job is to refuse a Verified without a recorded verdict,
#     answered PASS on that stub. S1955's PHASE_02 held `## Phase Done Criteria` twice
#     with opposite ticks, all [x] against all [ ], so the file asserted both that the
#     phase was done and that it had not started. S2156 carried an unfilled skeleton.
#   - The duplicate is judged INSIDE one level-1 block, not across the file. A compact
#     spec (the /spec-all Simple path) holds several `# Phase NN` blocks in one file and
#     each legitimately owns its `## Objective`, `## Files Touched`, `## Steps` and
#     `## Phase Done Criteria`. Judging per file reports six offenders on the current
#     tree of which three are those legitimate compact specs; judging per level-1 block
#     reports exactly the three real ones and nothing else.
#   - Fenced code blocks are skipped: a spec quotes markdown, and S2357's own section 0
#     quotes the very heading list that opened it.
#   - Scope is this ticket's own files - the strategic spec plus every .md in its tactical
#     folder - which is what makes it a per-ticket gate rather than a tree sweep
#     (CLAUDE.md rule 33). S1955's case lived in a phase file, so the folder is not
#     optional.
#   - Unlike the three sibling closing gates this one runs for BlockNeedUserTest too:
#     whether a file contradicts itself does not depend on the ticket being finished.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every heading is unique inside its level-1 block. 1 = a repeat found.
#             2 = bad invocation, or catalog / spec unreadable.
