.SYNOPSIS
    Fast, read-only check of one coordination domain - existence, age, holder. A bare Build or
    Code reports every domain of that type, one section each, every line naming its own domain.

.DESCRIPTION
    Never mutates the lock file (staleness is only ever reclaimed inside Enter-AgentLock, at
    the moment a caller actually wants the lock). Use this before starting a gradle-backed
    command or a multi-file code edit, to see whether another agent session currently holds
    the lock and how stale it looks.

    This is a STATUS QUERY (S1338 phase 09). "Held" is a normal answer to it, not a failure
    of the query, so the verdict travels in the payload (`status` = held | stale | free) and
    the process exits 0 either way. Non-zero is reserved for "could not determine".
    Pass -StrictExit for the legacy contract where held exits 1.

    -Wait blocks until the lock is free (or reclaimable) instead of reporting once. It exists
    because 793 polls and 48 hand-rolled `until .. sleep` loops were written against the
    single-shot form (S1338). Staleness is re-judged every poll, so a holder that dies is
    reported free immediately rather than waited out.

    -Queue also answers the question the raw listing could not (S1448): each ticket carries
    `heldByLockHolder`, and the JSON payload carries `headOwnedByHolder`. True means the queue
    head is the current lock holder's own leftover ticket - the holder owns both the lock and the
    turn, so nobody behind it can advance no matter how long they wait. In text mode such a row
    is suffixed `<- holds the lock`.

    -Queue also carries the stalled-holder verdict (S2413): held, a queue behind it, and an owner
    quiet for longer than the domain's LockStaleMinutes. Text mode prints a red STALLED line after
    the listing, `-Json` a `stall` property that is null when the domain is not stalled. It changes
    no exit code - a stalled holder is a status this query reports, not a failure of the query.

    Exit code: 0 = status determined and reported (free, stale, or held).
               2 = could not determine (lock file unreadable), or -Wait ran out of time.
               1 = held, ONLY under -StrictExit.
