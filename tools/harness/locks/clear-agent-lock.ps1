.SYNOPSIS
    Remove a stale agent lock, or forcibly clear a live one when explicitly requested.

.DESCRIPTION
    Default mode is conservative:
      - stale / dead / corrupt lock -> removed, exit 0
      - fresh live lock            -> refused, exit 1

    Use -Force only when you have confirmed the holder is gone and want to override the safety
    checks manually.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/utils/clear-agent-lock.ps1 -Name Build

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/utils/clear-agent-lock.ps1 -Name Code.Wear -Force

.NOTES
    Exit codes:
      0 - the named domain(s) are free: already free, or cleared here.
      1 - refused: a live holder was found and -Force was not given. Its pid, age, reason and
          session id are printed instead, because clearing a live lock hands the turn to the next
          agent mid-edit.
      2 - the resource name is not an accepted domain or bare type; nothing was inspected.
    With a bare Build or Code the worst per-domain code is returned, so one refused domain is
    still visible when its neighbours were free.
