.SYNOPSIS
    Cross-agent coordination locks: temp/BUILD.LOCK and temp/CODE.LOCK.

.DESCRIPTION
    Dot-source this file to get Enter-AgentLock / Exit-AgentLock / Get-AgentLockStatus /
    Enter-BuildLockOrExit. No top-level side effects other than resolving the repo root once.

    Two independent locks, deliberately different enforcement strength:
      - Build: a real OS process owns it for its whole lifetime, so staleness is judged by
        PID liveness (never by a guessed timeout while the process is actually alive - real
        builds legitimately run 10-25+ minutes). Enforced HARD - a leaf gradle-invoking script
        that can't acquire it must exit non-zero (see Enter-BuildLockOrExit).
      - Code: there is no persistent process to check (a Claude Code editing turn is not one
        continuous OS process - nothing runs between tool calls), so staleness is wall-clock
        only. Enforced SOFT by convention (CLAUDE.md rule + skills) - a build script that finds
        it fresh only warns, it never refuses, since nothing guarantees timely release.

    Lock file schema (single-line JSON, mirrors the existing .claude/scheduled_tasks.lock
    precedent):
      {"lockType":"Build","pid":12345,"procStart":<ticks>,"acquiredAt":<unix-ms>,
       "reason":"build-debug.PS1","host":"<COMPUTERNAME>"}

    S1432 adds a third state between free and held: QUEUED. Each lock has a queue directory
    temp/<NAME>.QUEUE holding one ticket file per waiter, named <seq:0000>__<sessionId>.json:
      {"schema":1,"seq":7,"lockType":"Build","sessionId":"<uuid>","host":"<COMPUTERNAME>",
       "pid":12345,"reason":"a.ps1 d","enqueuedAt":<unix-ms>,"transcriptPath":"<path|null>"}
    A ticket's owner is an agent SESSION, not a process: the waiter that holds a place exits
    the moment the turn arrives (its exit IS the "your turn" signal), so process liveness can
    never identify a live queue member. Liveness comes from the owning session's transcript
    write time - a live session appends to it every turn - with transcriptPath resolved once at
    enqueue time so a poll never rescans ~/.claude/projects. Timings per resource live in
    $Script:AgentLockTimings.

# Per-resource timings (S1432). Build keeps the pre-existing ceilings: a real build legitimately
# runs 10-25+ minutes, and a session waiting on one writes nothing to its transcript meanwhile.
# Code is deliberately shorter - an edit is a short burst of writes, not a long-running process,
# so a code ticket that has sat for 20 minutes is far more likely abandoned than working.
#
# S2098: TicketCeilingMinutes is declared for Build and Code below but read by NO queue consumer -
# only ticket-lease.ps1 and device-lease.ps1 apply the field. Queue eviction
# (Remove-StaleAgentLockTickets) judges the OWNER, never the ticket's age. That is deliberate, not
# an oversight: a legitimate wait behind one long build, or behind several queued builds, outlasts
# both numbers, so applying them would evict a session waiting exactly as the contract demands.
# The remedy for a ticket whose owner is alive but whose intent was dropped is therefore explicit,
# not a timer - scripts/utils/withdraw-lock-ticket.ps1. Do not wire these two values into the
# queue sweep without redoing that reasoning; an unannounced non-application reads as a working
# safety net, which is how the 2026-08-27 stall went unlooked-for.
#
# S2109: each concrete domain carries its own record, inheriting the values of its bare type
# unchanged - strategic section 5.1 pillar A makes ownership, eviction and head-of-queue
# reservation properties of the mechanism, not of the domain, and every one of those rules is
# read out of this table alone. A domain with different numbers would be a second policy.

        No session id in the environment - a plain shell, a cron run, a nested tool - falls back

        Added by S1596 as the shared accessor for an idiom that had been inlined four times.
        Existing call sites are left as they are - converting them is a separate change.

    # S2372: the chain itself lives in agent-identity.ps1 (FMS_AGENT_ID, then the session id, then

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Newest write time of a session's transcript, counting its subagents' transcripts too.
        $null when neither exists.
    .DESCRIPTION
        S2408 decision 7. A session that hands its work to a subagent writes nothing to
        <session>.jsonl for the whole run, while <session>/subagents/*.jsonl is written
        continuously - measured 2026-09-03, a six-minute gap between the two on a session that was
        editing the whole time, and on 2026-09-02 an eleven-minute one that lost its Code.Scripts
        lock to the ten-minute staleness window while its owner was mid-edit.

        Both the lock library's liveness and the lease's quiet-time reading call THIS function, so
        the two cannot judge different sets of files and disagree about one agent (S1621).

        Only the one session's own directory is enumerated, never the whole projects tree: this is
        called from the queue poll, which must read small (S1432 strategic 3.2). Measured warm at
        1.7 ms against a live session directory.

function Get-AgentTicketLiveness {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Verdict on a ticket's owner: self | foreign-live | foreign-stale | undetermined.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Same vocabulary as scripts/spec_catalog/spec-next-session.ps1, and for the same reason:
        the owner is a session, not a process, so the closest thing to a heartbeat is the write
        time of that session's transcript. Falls back to the ticket's own enqueue time when the
        transcript is unreachable (different machine, pruned history).

        'undetermined' means WE have no session id, so "mine" and "theirs" are indistinguishable -
        it must never be treated as grounds for eviction.

        S1448 - liveness signal precedence, strongest first, with S2408 adding the first entry:
          0. the owner's own process, when the id names one (host- or pid-). One-directional:
             it may only answer 'foreign-live', never 'foreign-stale';
          1. the ticket's own lastSeenAt heartbeat, written by the polling waiter that owns it;
          2. the owning session's transcript write time, counting the subagent subtree;
          3. the ticket's enqueuedAt, when none of the above is readable.
        The heartbeat leads the clock-based signals because a session that waits by the contract -
        background waiter plus lock-free work - produces no transcript writes, and was therefore
        being evicted for obeying the rules. The process check leads all of them because it is the
        only signal that observes the owner rather than a trace it left.

    .DESCRIPTION

        to be its transcript write time - which punishes exactly the behaviour the waiting
        contract demands: take a ticket, run the background waiter, do lock-free work. A session
        that waits quietly writes nothing, looks dead at SessionStaleMinutes, and gets evicted
        from a place it earned. The poll loop is proof the waiter is alive, so it records that
        proof here. Unlike Set-AgentTicketTurnGranted this rewrites on every call - it is a
        heartbeat, not a one-shot fact. This stamp deliberately does not extend TicketCeilingMinutes
        (S1448 ADR-3) - but that is moot for a queue, because S2098 found no queue consumer reads
        that field at all: an abandoned head does NOT age out, and the remedy is the owning session
        calling withdraw-lock-ticket.ps1. See the timings table for why applying it would be worse.

        Chaining the acquire onto the poll that observed the turn is what keeps a freed domain

        it, and there are exactly two shapes where it does not:

          - a BUILD domain, whose staleness is judged by the acquiring PID (Get-AgentLockStatus).
            The waiter exits the instant it acquires, so the lock would read as dead on arrival
            and the next caller would reclaim it out from under the session it was taken for;
          - a pid-<PID> session identity, the last resort of the identity chain. A code lock is
            judged by its owner session, so a lock stamped with one process's pid is foreign to
            every later process of the same session - including the one that asked for the wait.

        Everything else - a code domain under a stable identity - keeps the lock exactly as if
        the caller had acquired it itself, which is what makes the caller's re-run re-entrant.

        it as "not yet, blocked on <domain>" is what keeps the wait honest, and Position is the
        worst position across the set rather than the best.

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Which domain of a set is actually holding this caller back. Returns a domain name, or
        $null when nothing observable holds it.
    .DESCRIPTION
        S2410. A refused set has two different reasons and they live in two different places: a
        live LOCK on one of its domains, or a foreign ticket ahead of ours in one of its QUEUES.
        Test-AgentLockTurnSet answers the second question only, and answers it correctly - being
        head in every queue while a foreign lock is held is an ordinary state, and it reports
        BlockingDomain = $null for it.

        A caller that reads that $null as "no information" and substitutes the first domain of
        the set states something false rather than merely vague: the refusal then names a domain
        it can be seen to be free, so the message reads as a broken queue instead of a busy
        neighbour, and the wait it suggests returns instantly and refuses again.

        The lock is asked first because it is the stronger fact: a domain another session is
        editing right now blocks the set wherever our ticket sits in its queue.

        $null is a real answer, not a failure - the set was refused, yet no domain of it carries
        a live lock and this caller is head in every queue, which is a transient collision
        against a concurrent acquire. The caller MUST NOT name a domain in that case: there is
        no true one to name, and inventing one is the defect this function exists to remove.

function Save-AgentLockTicketHandoff {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Persist a ticket set to a per-intent handoff file. Returns the file path.
    .DESCRIPTION
        S2403. enter-code-lock and the waiter it instructs are separate pwsh processes, and in a
        runtime with no session id their pid-fallback identities never match, so the "one
        session, one place" dedup in New-AgentLockTicket cannot bridge them: the waiter took a
        SECOND ticket and then waited out the reservation window behind its own dead first one.
        The agent that reads the exit-4 message and copies the suggested command is the only
        session-scoped channel between the two processes, so the ticket travels in a uniquely
        named file that the suggested command carries by path.

        The file is disposable by design: nothing sweeps it, and a stale copy is inert because
        the reader rejects it by age and by "seq still queued" - the worst failure is a fresh
        ticket, which is exactly the pre-S2403 behaviour.

        liveness have both lapsed - adopting one would claim a place the queue has reclaimed.

function Resolve-AgentLockTopUp {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Split a requested domain set into what this session already holds and what is still
        missing, and judge whether a top-up (acquire the missing domains, keep the held ones) is
        safe. Returns @{ Domains; Held; Missing; AscendingSafe }.
    .DESCRIPTION
        S2200. `Enter-AgentLockDomain` has no self-ownership check - a domain this session already
        holds is judged "busy" exactly like a foreign holder's, so a superset request queues the
        caller behind its own lock. That queue entry can never be granted from the outside (the
        only release is this session's own future Exit-AgentLock, which runs only after the
        request already unblocked), so treating it as an ordinary wait is a livelock, not a delay.

        Safety of a top-up is not a single yes/no - it depends on canonical rank (research
        artifact PLAN/S2200_.../research/01). Granting the missing domains while keeping the held
        ones is equivalent to continuing an already-in-progress canonical-order acquisition, and
        inherits that acquisition's deadlock-freedom, only when every held domain outranks every
        missing one - i.e. the caller is extending strictly upward through the table. Extending
        downward (holding a higher-ranked domain, needing to add a lower-ranked one) would let a
        symmetric session holding the lower one and needing the higher deadlock against it - the
        exact AB-BA shape canonical order exists to rule out. That direction is reported unsafe
        here and must fall back to release-then-retake, never a direct grant.

        S2109. The name resolves through Resolve-AgentLockDomains into a set, and the set is
        taken in that table's canonical order. Two properties make this safe, and neither is
        optional (strategic section 5.1 pillar D):

          - Canonical order. Two sessions whose sets overlap take the shared domains in the same
            sequence, so one of them always gets the first contested domain and the other always
            queues. Letting callers choose the order is what produces a mutual block with no
            timeout to break it.
          - All or nothing. A domain that cannot be taken releases every domain already taken in
            THIS call before returning, so a refusal never leaves half a set held. A caller that
            waits therefore sleeps holding nothing.

        The returned Status is the blocking domain's on a refusal and the last acquired domain's
        on success; Domains carries the whole set either way.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Best-effort release of ONE concrete domain. Safe to call unconditionally from a `finally`
        block, even if the lock was never acquired in this process (no-op).

    .DESCRIPTION
        Build and Code have different ownership models, so release differs:
          - Build: acquire and release always happen in the SAME long-running OS process (one
            leaf script's lifetime), so only remove when the recorded pid matches the current
            process - this is what makes it safe to call unconditionally from a `finally`
            without risking deleting a DIFFERENT live build's lock.
          - Code: acquire (scripts/utils/enter-code-lock.ps1) and release
            (scripts/post-change.ps1's finally, or scripts/utils/exit-code-lock.ps1) are
            deliberately DIFFERENT OS processes - each is its own short-lived pwsh invocation,
            with no single process spanning a whole editing turn. A pid-match check here would
            never fire and the lock would never actually be released before its wall-clock
            staleness window. So Code is released unconditionally (best-effort remove) - it is
            already Tier-2/advisory (see agent-lock.ps1 header), so the small risk of racing an
            unrelated concurrent release is an acceptable soft failure mode.

        An environment variable inside a running process is a snapshot taken when that process
        started. A long-lived agent session carries the snapshot for hours, so a JDK point-update
        on the machine leaves it naming a directory that no longer exists while the machine's own
        persisted value is already correct. Observed 2026-08-21: every gradle target of a session
        failed identically for the rest of that session, and the fix was to restart the process.

        This is deliberately NOT a fallback-JDK search. It never looks at the disk, never considers
        the Android Studio jbr, and can only ever return a value the operator persisted themselves -
        the very value the stale snapshot is a snapshot OF. Picking a JVM nobody configured is what
        the guard below is right to refuse; refreshing a snapshot is a different act.

        All three conditions are required. A persisted value equal to the snapshot has nothing to
        refresh - the JDK really is gone. An unusable one is not worth taking. An absent one leaves
        the refusal exactly as it was.

        Returns the usable persisted value with the scope it came from, or $null.

        Exit codes this function can impose on its caller:
          1 - BUILD.LOCK held and fail-fast was requested (-NoWait / FMS_LOCK_NO_WAIT=1).
          2 - the wait ran out of time; nothing was inspected and nothing was built.
          3 - the launcher JVM (JAVA_HOME) or the configured toolchain JVM cannot launch
              (see Assert-GradleToolchainOrExit - it checks both, and they can differ).

    # S2058: the inherited half of this check is PID plus process-start ticks, not PID alone. A
    # spawned child process inherits FMS_BUILD_LOCK_HELD_BY from whatever ancestor last acquired
    # the lock in-process; a bare PID match against the CURRENT lock file's holder is therefore
    # only safe as long as PIDs are never reused. Windows reuses them quickly, and a long-lived
    # ancestor spawning many short-lived children makes the collision realistic - when it lands,
    # the child mistook an unrelated, later holder for itself and returned as though it already
    # held BUILD.LOCK, without queueing or actually holding it (observed exit 0 on a refusal that
    # should have queued or failed fast). Start ticks are what Get-AgentLockStatus already uses
    # to defend the SAME lock file against PID reuse a few lines below - this mirrors it rather
    # than inventing a second defense.
    # S2109: the guard has to look at the domains this call will actually take. Asking the bare
    # name would read a file nothing writes any more, so the guard would never fire and a nested
    # gradle script would queue behind its own ancestor - a hang, not a refusal.
