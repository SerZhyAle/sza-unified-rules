.SYNOPSIS
    Release every code domain this session holds. Safe no-op if unheld or held by another session.

.DESCRIPTION
    scripts/post-change.ps1 already calls this automatically from its own finally block, so
    most skills never need to call it directly. Skills that skip post-change.ps1 (e.g.
    /skill-fix) must call this explicitly once their edit is done.

    S1432: the release is owner-checked. A lock held by ANOTHER live session is left in place
    and reported, because with a queue behind the lock, releasing someone else's lock hands the
    turn to the wrong session. A lock with no session id (written before S1432) or one whose
    owner has gone quiet is still released, so nothing can get permanently stuck.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/utils/exit-code-lock.ps1
#>
. (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot '..\_profile.ps1')
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
. "$PSScriptRoot\agent-lock.ps1"

Exit-AgentLock -Name Code
# Report what actually happened: an owner-checked release can legitimately leave the file in
# place, and saying "released" then would be a false completion claim.
#
# S2170: the verdict is read per DOMAIN, never off the bare name. The release above already fans
# out across all three code domains, but the check afterwards used to look at the single pre-split
# file - which nothing writes any more - so a domain that stayed behind was reported as released.

foreach ($domain in @(Resolve-AgentLockDomains -Name 'Code')) {
    $after = Get-AgentLockStatus -Name $domain
    if (-not ($after.Exists -and -not $after.Stale)) { continue }
    $stillHeld += $domain
    # S2109: say WHOSE it is. This line used to assert "another live session" without checking,
    # so a lock this session still held after a failed release was reported as somebody else's -
    # which is the one reading that stops the holder from investigating its own leak.
    $owner = [string]$after.SessionId
    # S2371: same accessor the lock was written with, so a pid-fallback holder is told the
    # surviving lock is its own instead of being reported as another live session.
